On this repo I'll be mainly working on understanding data structures and algorithms in python, taking consideration on their worst case time and space coplexities using Big O Notation.<br>
Got a good resource at Free Code Camp facilitated by jovian (a'll add the link here).<br>
As an aspiring data scientist this will help improve my approach to problems and even improve my problem solving tchniques.<br>
It's a twelve hours course covering all the basic data structures in python i.e Binary Search Algorithm, Linear Search and many more that a'll get to list as I continue in this journey.<br>
