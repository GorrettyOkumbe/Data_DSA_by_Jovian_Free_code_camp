On this repo I'll be mainly working on understanding data structures and algorithms in python.
Got a good resource at Free Code Camp facilitated by jovian (a'll add the link here).
As an aspiring data scientist this will help improve my approach to problems and even improve my problem solving tchniques.
It's a twelve hours course covering all the basic data structures in python i.e Binary Search Algorithm, Linear Search and many more that a'll get to list as I continue in this journey.
